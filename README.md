## Usage and Features

Log in and find your dam bookings, other users, and a list of dams on your dashboard. Click any section to take you to further details of that item. Browse the list of dams to find one that meets your needs. You will find a photo and Google Map on each page, so you can see exactly where it is an how long it will take to get there.

The user database is a handy way to find and contact other club members, you can find their email and phone number here. You can edit your own user profile and change your password by clicking your name in the top right corner.

Admins can add, edit, and delete users, dams and bookings.

- Email confirmation for land owner and user
- Add change password page so it is separate to editing other profile details.
- Allow users to opt-in and out of sharing their name/email/phone in the user directory.
